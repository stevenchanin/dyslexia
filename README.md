# Dyslexia Reading Intervention Software

A comprehensive, evidence-based software application designed to help individuals with dyslexia improve their reading skills through engaging computer exercises.

## Project Overview

This application provides structured literacy intervention based on the Orton-Gillingham method and multicomponent reading instruction. Research shows that **95% of children with dyslexia can achieve functional literacy** with appropriate evidence-based intervention.

### Core Features

- **Interactive Exercise Modules**
  - Phonological Awareness Training
  - Phonics & Decoding Practice
  - Word Recognition & Fluency
  - Reading Comprehension
  - Spelling & Encoding

- **Progress Tracking & Measurement**
  - Words Correct Per Minute (WCPM) calculation
  - Skill mastery tracking across multiple areas
  - Visual progress dashboards
  - Weekly and monthly reports

- **Engagement & Motivation**
  - Adaptive difficulty adjustment
  - Points, badges, and achievements
  - Spaced repetition for retention
  - Personalized learning paths

- **Accessibility Features**
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) support
  - Adjustable text size and contrast
  - Clean interface (Arial font - research shows special dyslexia fonts provide no benefit)
  - Multi-sensory learning approach

## Documentation

The research and planning phase is complete. Detailed documentation includes:

- **[RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md)** - Comprehensive research on dyslexia intervention methods, exercise types, and assessment metrics
- **[FEATURE_DESIGN.md](./FEATURE_DESIGN.md)** - Complete feature specifications, exercise modules, progress tracking, and UX design
- **[TECHNICAL_PLAN.md](./TECHNICAL_PLAN.md)** - Full technical architecture, database schema, API design, and 26-week implementation roadmap
- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Material-UI/Chakra UI, Web Audio API
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Audio**: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Railway/Render (backend), Auth0 (authentication)

## Current Status

✅ Research phase complete
✅ Feature design complete
✅ Technical architecture complete
⬜ Implementation phase - Ready to begin

## Getting Started

Implementation hasn't begun yet. When development starts:

```bash
# Setup instructions will be added here
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [TECHNICAL_PLAN.md](./TECHNICAL_PLAN.md) for the complete development roadmap and setup instructions.

## Key Research Findings

- Structured Literacy and Orton-Gillingham methods are most effective
- Computer-assisted instruction is as effective as traditional delivery
- WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute) is the best fluency metric
- Special dyslexia fonts (OpenDyslexic, Dyslexie) show no benefit - use Arial
- Multicomponent interventions targeting multiple skills simultaneously are most effective
- Adaptive difficulty and spaced repetition improve outcomes
