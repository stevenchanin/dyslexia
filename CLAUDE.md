This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a software application designed to help people with dyslexia improve their reading skills through computer-based exercises.

### Core Objectives
- Provide on-computer exercises that develop reading skills
- Implement measurements of success so users can track progress
- Consider integration of special fonts designed for dyslexia

### Current Status
This is an early-stage project in the research and planning phase. The codebase does not yet contain implementation code.

### Next Steps (from README)
1. Research dyslexia and established protocols for improving reading skills
2. Design specific exercises and features that develop and measure these skills
3. Plan the technical implementation

## Development Guidelines

When implementing this project, consider:
- Accessibility is paramount - the target users have dyslexia
- Progress tracking and measurement features are core requirements
- Evidence-based approaches to dyslexia intervention should guide feature design
