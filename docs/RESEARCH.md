# Dyslexia Reading Intervention Research

## Executive Summary

Research shows that approximately **95% of children with dyslexia can achieve functional literacy** when they receive appropriate evidence-based intervention. Computer-assisted instruction shows comparable effectiveness to traditional delivery models, making software-based intervention highly viable.

## Evidence-Based Intervention Methods

### 1. Structured Literacy (Gold Standard)
The most effective approach that explicitly teaches the logic behind the English writing system through systematic instruction.

#### Core Components (Multicomponent Approach)
1. **Phonological Awareness** - Understanding and manipulating sounds in spoken language
2. **Systematic Phonics** - Letter-sound relationships and decoding
3. **Word Reading** - Recognition and decoding of whole words
4. **Spelling** - Encoding words using phonetic knowledge
5. **Connected-Text Reading** - Reading fluency in context
6. **Comprehension** - Understanding meaning while reading

### 2. Orton-Gillingham Method
Research shows this is one of the most effective dyslexia intervention approaches:
- Structured multisensory approach
- Explicit teaching of reading, writing, and spelling
- Breaks down concepts into simple building blocks
- Progressively builds on foundational skills

### 3. Technology-Assisted Instruction (2025 Research)
Recent studies demonstrate that intensive, comprehensive, multicomponent interventions delivered through technology show comparable student progress to traditional models.

## Computer-Based Intervention Programs - Key Features

### Effective Program Characteristics
1. **Adaptive and Personalized**
   - Identifies individual student needs
   - Presents appropriate exercises based on skill level
   - Adjusts difficulty dynamically

2. **Engagement Focus**
   - Children with dyslexia often struggle with focus
   - Programs must be engaging to maintain motivation
   - Repetition needs to be gamified or made interactive

3. **Targeted Skill Development**
   - Processing speed exercises
   - Working memory training
   - Attention span improvement
   - Sequencing skills

4. **Multimodal Presentation**
   - Uses sounds and slowed language that speeds up progressively
   - Visual and auditory reinforcement
   - Text-to-speech (TTS) support for comprehension

### Research-Backed Software Approaches
- **Fast ForWord**: Exercises language and cognitive skill gaps, focuses on pre-reading skills
- **Dysolve AI**: AI-powered software showing promising results for reading improvement
- **What Works Clearinghouse**: 5 of 7 evaluated programs showed significant impact on word-level reading skills

### Best Practice Combination
Research indicates the **most effective approach** combines:
- Direct teaching program (structured instruction)
- Computer-based practice program (skill reinforcement)

## Specific Exercise Types

### Phonological Awareness Activities
1. **Onset and Rime** - Breaking words into initial sound and ending
2. **Word Families** - Recognizing patterns in related words
3. **Isolated Sound Recognition** - Identifying individual phonemes
4. **Phoneme Counting** - Determining number of sounds in words
5. **Sound Synthesis** - Blending sounds to form words
6. **Sound-to-Word Matching** - Connecting sounds to whole words
7. **Sound Position Identification** - Locating sounds within words (beginning, middle, end)
8. **Sound Segmentation** - Breaking words into component sounds
9. **Letter-Sound Association** - Connecting graphemes to phonemes
10. **Sound Deletion** - Removing sounds and identifying resulting words
11. **Rhyming Games** - Recognizing and producing rhymes
12. **Sound Manipulation** - Changing sounds to create new words (cat → rat)

### Effective Teaching Sequence
Focus immediately on:
1. Phoneme awareness instruction
2. Coordinated with letter/grapheme knowledge
3. Handwriting practice
4. Building to connected text reading

## Progress Measurement & Assessment

### Key Metrics

#### 1. Foundational Skills
- Phonological awareness accuracy
- Letter-sound knowledge
- Decoding accuracy

#### 2. Oral Reading Fluency
- **WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute)** - Primary metric
- Highly sensitive to growth
- Better than traditional standardized measures for monitoring

#### 3. Literal Comprehension
- Understanding of text meaning
- Question answering accuracy

#### 4. Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN)
- Speed of naming familiar items
- Strong predictor of reading ability

#### 5. Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF)
- Tests decoding skills independent of vocabulary
- Measures pure phonetic ability

### Assessment Tools & Approaches

#### Adaptive Assessment
- **MAP Reading Fluency** - 30 minutes or less for complete reading profile
- Can screen entire class simultaneously
- Provides benchmark and progress monitoring
- Includes dyslexia risk screening

#### One-Minute Skills Assessments
- **mCLASS DIBELS 8th Edition**
- Brief assessments highly sensitive to growth
- Efficient data collection for RTI paradigms

#### Progress Monitoring Best Practices
- Frequent brief assessments (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Track multiple metrics simultaneously
- Compare growth to expected trajectories
- Visual progress dashboards for student motivation

### Dyslexia Risk Screening
Modern screeners use predictive models combining:
- Foundational skills measures
- RAN measures
- NWF measures
- To flag students at risk for dyslexia

## Special Fonts - Research Findings

### Key Finding: Limited Effectiveness
**Scientific consensus: Dyslexia-specific fonts show no measurable benefit over standard fonts.**

### Research on OpenDyslexic
- No improvement in reading rate or accuracy
- No shorter eye fixation times
- No preference from readers with dyslexia
- Performs no better than Arial or Times New Roman

### Research on Dyslexie Font
- 170 children tested - no improvement over Arial
- Not preferred by children with dyslexia
- Actually performed worse in some studies
- Arial was the most preferred font

### Recommendation
**Use standard, clean sans-serif fonts like Arial** rather than investing in specialized dyslexia fonts. User preference and readability matter more than font design.

## Design Principles for Software

### 1. Accessibility First
- High contrast options
- Adjustable text size
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Clear sans-serif fonts (Arial recommended)

### 2. Motivation & Engagement
- Progress visualization (charts, badges, achievements)
- Immediate feedback
- Gamification elements
- Short, achievable goals

### 3. Evidence-Based Progression
- Start with phonological awareness
- Build systematically to connected text
- Multiple repetitions with variation
- Multimodal presentation

### 4. Measurement & Tracking
- Automated WCPM calculation
- Track multiple skill areas simultaneously
- Show progress over time
- Identify areas needing additional practice

### 5. Adaptive Difficulty
- Adjust based on performance
- Maintain appropriate challenge level
- Prevent frustration from too-difficult tasks
- Prevent boredom from too-easy tasks
