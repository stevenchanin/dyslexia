# Dyslexia Reading Intervention Research

## Executive Summary

Early, high‑fidelity, evidence‑based instruction enables the vast majority of students with reading difficulties, including dyslexia, to reach functional literacy. Outcomes vary with age of identification, instructional intensity and fidelity, and co‑occurring conditions. Computer‑assisted instruction can effectively support practice and reinforcement when grounded in explicit instruction, though effects vary by design and implementation.

## Evidence-Based Intervention Methods

### 1. Structured Literacy (Gold Standard)
The most effective approach that explicitly teaches the logic behind the English writing system through systematic instruction.

#### Core Components (Multicomponent Approach)
1. **Phonological Awareness** - Understanding and manipulating sounds in spoken language
2. **Systematic Phonics** - Letter-sound relationships and decoding
3. **Word Reading** - Recognition and decoding of whole words
4. **Spelling** - Encoding words using phonetic knowledge
5. **Connected-Text Reading** - Reading fluency in context
6. **Comprehension** - Understanding meaning while reading

### 2. Orton-Gillingham and Related Approaches
Approaches commonly associated with Orton‑Gillingham align with structured literacy principles (explicit, systematic, cumulative, diagnostic). The strongest evidence base supports these principles themselves rather than any single branded program.
- Multisensory techniques used in service of explicit instruction
- Explicit teaching of reading, writing, and spelling
- Concepts broken into teachable steps with cumulative review
- Progress builds systematically on mastered skills

### 3. Technology-Assisted Instruction (2025 Research)
Recent reviews suggest technology‑assisted interventions can yield small to moderate gains, especially as guided practice adjuncts to explicit instruction. Effect sizes vary by implementation quality and alignment to core reading components.

## Computer-Based Intervention Programs - Key Features

### Effective Program Characteristics
1. **Adaptive and Personalized**
   - Identifies individual student needs
   - Presents appropriate exercises based on skill level
   - Adjusts difficulty dynamically

2. **Engagement Focus**
   - Children with dyslexia often struggle with focus
   - Programs must be engaging to maintain motivation
   - Repetition needs to be gamified or made interactive

3. **Targeted Skill Development**
   - Core reading skills first: phonological awareness, decoding/encoding, word reading, connected‑text fluency, vocabulary, comprehension
   - Supplemental (optional): practice that engages attention/working memory when tightly coupled to reading tasks

4. **Multimodal Presentation**
   - Uses sounds and slowed language that speeds up progressively
   - Visual and auditory reinforcement
   - Text-to-speech (TTS) support for comprehension

### Research-Backed Software Approaches
- **Fast ForWord**: Exercises language and cognitive skill gaps, focuses on pre-reading skills
- **Dysolve AI**: AI-powered software showing promising results for reading improvement
- **What Works Clearinghouse**: 5 of 7 evaluated programs showed significant impact on word-level reading skills

### Best Practice Combination
Research indicates the **most effective approach** combines:
- Direct teaching program (structured instruction)
- Computer-based practice program (skill reinforcement)

## Specific Exercise Types

### Phonological Awareness Activities
1. **Onset and Rime** - Breaking words into initial sound and ending
2. **Word Families** - Recognizing patterns in related words
3. **Isolated Sound Recognition** - Identifying individual phonemes
4. **Phoneme Counting** - Determining number of sounds in words
5. **Sound Synthesis** - Blending sounds to form words
6. **Sound-to-Word Matching** - Connecting sounds to whole words
7. **Sound Position Identification** - Locating sounds within words (beginning, middle, end)
8. **Sound Segmentation** - Breaking words into component sounds
9. **Letter-Sound Association** - Connecting graphemes to phonemes
10. **Sound Deletion** - Removing sounds and identifying resulting words
11. **Rhyming Games** - Recognizing and producing rhymes
12. **Sound Manipulation** - Changing sounds to create new words (cat → rat)

### Effective Teaching Sequence
Focus immediately on:
1. Phoneme awareness instruction
2. Coordinated with letter/grapheme knowledge
3. Handwriting practice
4. Building to connected text reading

## Instructional Scope and Sequence (Guidance)

A clear, cumulative scope‑and‑sequence is essential. All decoding/encoding activities and connected texts should align to taught code.

Suggested placeholder sequence (to be adapted to final curriculum):
- Consonants and short vowels; CVC words; basic blending/segmenting
- Common digraphs: ch, sh, th, wh, ck; initial/final blends
- CVCe (silent‑e), long vowels; soft c/g
- R‑controlled vowels: ar, er, ir, or, ur
- Vowel teams/diphthongs: ai/ay, ee/ea, oa/ow, oi/oy, ou/ow, aw/au, ew/ui, etc.
- Syllable types and division: closed, open, magic‑e, vowel team, r‑controlled, consonant‑le
- Multisyllabic decoding strategies; morphology (common prefixes/suffixes, base words)

Decodable texts and fluency passages should be controlled to the currently taught patterns to minimize guessing and support orthographic mapping.

## Progress Measurement & Assessment

### Key Metrics

#### 1. Foundational Skills
- Phonological awareness accuracy
- Letter-sound knowledge
- Decoding accuracy

#### 2. Oral Reading Fluency
- **WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute)** - Primary metric
- Highly sensitive to growth
- Better than traditional standardized measures for monitoring
 - If using automated speech recognition (ASR) to score oral reading, validate against human scoring with your target population; provide a manual fallback due to child‑speech variability, background noise, and latency.

#### 3. Literal Comprehension
- Understanding of text meaning
- Question answering accuracy

#### 4. Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN)
- Speed of naming familiar items
- Strong predictor of reading ability

#### 5. Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF)
- Tests decoding skills independent of vocabulary
- Measures pure phonetic ability

### Assessment Tools & Approaches

#### Adaptive Assessment
- **MAP Reading Fluency** - 30 minutes or less for complete reading profile
- Can screen entire class simultaneously
- Provides benchmark and progress monitoring
- Includes dyslexia risk screening

#### One-Minute Skills Assessments
- **mCLASS DIBELS 8th Edition**
- Brief assessments highly sensitive to growth
- Efficient data collection for RTI paradigms

#### Progress Monitoring Best Practices
- Frequent brief assessments (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Track multiple metrics simultaneously
- Compare growth to expected trajectories
- Visual progress dashboards for student motivation

### Dyslexia Risk Screening
Modern screeners use predictive models combining:
- Foundational skills measures
- RAN measures
- NWF measures
- To flag students at risk for dyslexia

## Special Fonts - Research Findings

### Key Finding: Limited Effectiveness
**Scientific consensus: Dyslexia-specific fonts show no measurable benefit over standard fonts.**

### Research on OpenDyslexic
- No improvement in reading rate or accuracy
- No shorter eye fixation times
- No preference from readers with dyslexia
- Performs no better than Arial or Times New Roman

### Research on Dyslexie Font
- 170 children tested - no improvement over Arial
- Not preferred by children with dyslexia
- Actually performed worse in some studies
- Arial was the most preferred font

### Recommendation
**Use standard, clean sans-serif fonts like Arial** rather than investing in specialized dyslexia fonts. User preference and readability matter more than font design.

## Design Principles for Software

### 1. Accessibility First
- High contrast options
- Adjustable text size
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Clear sans-serif fonts (Arial recommended)

### 2. Motivation & Engagement
- Progress visualization (charts, badges, achievements)
- Immediate feedback
- Gamification elements
- Short, achievable goals

### 3. Evidence-Based Progression
- Start with phonological awareness
- Build systematically to connected text
- Multiple repetitions with variation
- Multimodal presentation

### 4. Measurement & Tracking
- Automated WCPM calculation
- Track multiple skill areas simultaneously
- Show progress over time
- Identify areas needing additional practice

### 5. Adaptive Difficulty
- Adjust based on performance
- Maintain appropriate challenge level
- Prevent frustration from too-difficult tasks
- Prevent boredom from too-easy tasks

## Implementation Recommendations (Synthesis)

- Emphasize structured literacy principles: explicit, systematic, cumulative instruction across phonological awareness, phonics/decoding, connected‑text fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
- Anchor all instruction to a written scope‑and‑sequence; align exercises, encoding tasks, and decodable/controlled texts to taught code.
- Define mastery criteria and advancement rules; use consistent corrective feedback (e.g., model–lead–test, immediate return to point of error).
- Use repeated reading with WCPM and accuracy tracking for fluency; graph growth over time.
- Treat ASR‑based WCPM as a Tier‑2 enhancement; validate before using for placement or high‑stakes decisions.
- Keep domain‑general cognitive training supplemental; prioritize reading‑specific practice tightly tied to phonology/orthography.
