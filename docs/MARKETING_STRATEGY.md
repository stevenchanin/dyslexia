Hi [Name],

I noticed you cover [EdTech/parenting/AI in education] for [Publication].

I'm launching something you might find interesting: a completely free, AI-powered dyslexia intervention app designed for low-income families who can't afford the $100-600/month programs currently available.

Key angles:
- 4-5 million low-income US students have dyslexia and lack access to intervention
- We use LLMs (like ChatGPT) to provide personalized tutoring for pennies per student
- Mobile-first PWA works offline (critical for limited data plans)
- Evidence-based (Orton-Gillingham, Structured Literacy)
- Open source

Early pilot data: [if available: X students improved WCPM by Y% in Z weeks]

Would you be interested in covering the launch or speaking with me about it?

Happy to provide:
- Demo access
- Pilot data
- Founder interview
- User testimonials

[Your Name]
[Contact]

```

**Cost:** $0 (free HARO, free PR sites)

## The Competitive Moat

**Why this marketing strategy works for us:**

1. **Authenticity** - We're mission-driven, not profit-driven (families can tell)
2. **Free** - Removes friction for word-of-mouth ("just try it, it's free")
3. **Real solution** - Not a gimmick, solves real problem
4. **Underserved market** - 4-5 million families desperately need this
5. **Technology edge** - AI-powered = press-worthy, shareable
6. **Open source** - Developer community supports and advocates

**Most importantly:** If the product truly helps children learn to read, word-of-mouth will be unstoppable. Focus on making the best free dyslexia tool ever created, and marketing becomes exponentially easier.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Mission first, always** - Every decision optimizes for impact, not vanity metrics
2. **Community over campaigns** - Deep engagement beats broad advertising
3. **Parents are champions** - Empower them to spread the word
4. **Schools are multipliers** - One district = hundreds of families
5. **Proof over promises** - Show data, share outcomes, earn trust
6. **Patience pays** - This is a marathon (like SEO), not a sprint

---

## Action Plan Summary

**Immediate (Before Launch):**
- [ ] Join 20-30 dyslexia Facebook groups
- [ ] Create social media accounts
- [ ] Write 10-15 SEO blog posts
- [ ] Recruit 10-20 beta families
- [ ] Build email list for launch supporters

**Launch Week:**
- [ ] Product Hunt (Thursday)
- [ ] Hacker News (Friday)
- [ ] Reddit posts
- [ ] Email dyslexia communities
- [ ] Press outreach

**First 90 Days:**
- [ ] Engage in Facebook groups daily
- [ ] Publish 2-3 blog posts/week
- [ ] Reach out to 50 school districts
- [ ] Start 5-10 school pilots
- [ ] Approach 10 nonprofits for partnerships
- [ ] Build referral system into app

**Long-term (Ongoing):**

- [ ] Partner outreach (weekly)

## The Bottom Line

**You don't need a big budget to reach families who need this. You need:**

1. ✅ A genuinely helpful solution (we have this)
2. ✅ The communities where your audience already gathers (we identified them)
3. ✅ Authentic engagement and trust-building (takes time, not money)
4. ✅ Built-in viral mechanisms (referrals, sharing)
5. ✅ Patience and persistence (word-of-mouth compounds)

**Your advantage:** Solving a painful problem for free in a market where competitors charge $100-600/month creates enormous word-of-mouth potential.

**The strategy:** Go where the families are (Facebook groups, schools, nonprofits), provide genuine value, let the product speak for itself, and watch organic growth compound.

**Expected timeline:** 6-12 months to reach first 10,000 users through zero-budget tactics. After that, word-of-mouth accelerates adoption.

**Most important:** If the product truly helps children with dyslexia learn to read, marketing takes care of itself. Focus on building something amazing, and families will spread the word.

**Let's make comprehensive dyslexia intervention accessible to every family, regardless of income.** 🚀
